# Hello, World! (For the Senior Developer Who's Seen It All)

Welcome to the `hello-world` repository, a groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting, and utterly essential piece of software that will revolutionize the way you... well, say "hello."

## What is this?

This is `hello-world`. If you're a senior developer, you've probably written it more times than you've debugged a `NullPointerException` at 3 AM. It's the "Hello, World!" of "Hello, Worlds!".

## Why another one?

Because the world needed a `hello-world` that truly resonated with the seasoned professional. One that understands the pain of legacy code, the joy of a perfectly refactored module, and the existential dread of another all-hands meeting.

## Features (or lack thereof)

*   **Zero dependencies:** Because who needs another `node_modules` folder the size of a small moon?
*   **Blazingly fast:** It prints "Hello, World!" before you can even finish your artisanal coffee.
*   **Infinitely scalable:** Can print "Hello, World!" to millions of users, or just your cat.
*   **Enterprise-grade:** We've considered adding blockchain integration, but decided against it for performance reasons (and because it's "Hello, World!").
*   **Self-documenting:** The code is so simple, even a junior developer could understand it. (Just kidding, we know you'll still add 50 lines of Javadoc.)
